   		 <h2>About Me</h2>
   		 
	  		<p>Hello, I am Alejandro Zuniga a student at Eastern Washington University majoring in Visual Communication Design (VCD) with a minor in Technical Communications. I transferred to Eastern Washington University after getting my Associates at Wenatchee Valley College. I am an amateur Graphic Designer, and a car enthusiast. I enjoy driving fast, buying car parts, and installing them. I enjoy having a vision for my car, and being able to create that vision a reality.  I chose the VCD major because I've always loved creating things, and have enjoyed the process from beginning to end.
        </p>
